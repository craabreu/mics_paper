\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we show that MBAR is intimately related to the expanded ensemble method. Second, and most importantly, 

\section{Definitions}
\label{sec:definitions}

Consider that $x$ represents the set of coordinates of a system that can be found at different equilibrium states. Each state $i$ is a statistical ensemble distinguished by a conditional probability density
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:state_prob_density}
\rho_i(x) = \frac{1}{Z_i} e^{-u_i(x)},
\end{equation}
where $u_i(x)$ is a \textit{reduced potential}\cite{Shirts_2008, Chodera_2011} with known functional form and $Z_i = \int e^{-u_i(x)}dx$ is an unknown normalization constant, referred to as the configurational integral or partition function of the system at state $i$. The ensemble average or equilibrium expectation of a property $A(x)$ at state $i$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ensemble average}
\langle A \rangle_i = \int A(x)\rho_i(x)dx.
\end{equation}

Assume that $n_i$ configurations $\{x_{i,k}\}_{k=1}^{n_i}$ were obtained via importance sampling\cite{Allen_1987} (e.g. MC or MD) at state $i$. In this case, we can estimate $\langle A \rangle_i$ by a simple arithmetic average, that is,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:average_estimator}
\bar A_i = \frac{1}{n_i} \sum_{k=1}^{n_i} A(x_{i,k}).
\end{equation}

We are often interested in computing the difference between the reduced free energies of two states $i$ and $j$, defined as $\Delta f_{ij} = f_j - f_i = - \ln (Z_j/Z_i)$. Because it is usually unfeasible to compute absolute free energies, we find it appropriate to define $f_i$ as a relative value with respect to a state $0$, chosen as a common reference to all other states of interest, which makes $f_i = -\ln (Z_i/Z_0)$. This allows us to rewrite Eq.~\eqref{eq:state_prob_density} as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:state_prob_density_Z0}
\rho_i(x) = \frac{1}{Z_0} e^{-u_i(x)+ f_i}.
\end{equation}

It is clear, thus, that the vector $\vt f$ can only be determined up to an additive constant and this fact will be assumed henceforth. Estimation of each $f_i$ can be done by relating it to one or more ensemble averages. However, we must remark that the tails of $\rho_i(x)$ are usually overlooked in importance sampling, meaning that only a limited region $C_i$ of the configurational space is sampled with reasonable accuracy. As in Ref.~\onlinecite{Jarzynski_2006}, we refer to $C_i$ as the set of \textit{typical} configurations of state $i$. It does not necessarily coincide with the set $D_i$ of configurations that substantially contribute to the integral in Eq.~\eqref{eq:ensemble average}, referred to as the \textit{dominant} configurations. In fact, the estimator described in Eq.~\eqref{eq:average_estimator} will be accurate only if $D_i$ is a significant subset of $C_i$. This issue is particularly important in the calculation of free-energy differences and their uncertainties.

\section{Existing Free-Energy Computation and Property Reweighting Methods}

Traditional methods such as Free Energy Perturbation (FEP),\cite{Zwanzig_1954} Simple Overlap Sampling,\cite{Lee_1980, Lu_2003} and Bennett's Acceptance Ratio (BAR)\cite{Bennett_1976} are pairwise with respect to the calculation of free-energy differences between sampled states. These are computed independently for the pairs of states whose sets of typical configurations overlap most considerably. The additive nature of this property then allows us to piece these values together and obtain free-energy differences for poorly- or non-overlapping pairs of states. This strategy is known as \textit{staging}.\cite{Kofke_1998} Among the cited methods, FEP is the least recommended one. Given two states $i$ and $j$, it consists in evaluating either $\Delta f_{ij} = -\ln \langle e^{u_i - u_j} \rangle_i$ or $\Delta f_{ij} = \ln \langle e^{u_j - u_i} \rangle_j$.\cite{Zwanzig_1954} It happens, however, that these averages entail dominant sets $D_i$ and $D_j$ that practically coincide with the typical sets $C_j$ and $C_i$, respectively.\cite{Jarzynski_2006} Note that this is opposite to the situation that would maximize accuracy. On the other hand, BAR is the most accurate method because it manages, in an iterative way, to relate $\Delta f_{ij}$ to ensemble averages computed at states $i$ and $j$ whose dominant sets $D_i$ and $D_j$ fulfill the intersection between $C_i$ and $C_j$.

Another way of tackling the issue of overlap deficiency consists in defining a reference state, with probability density $\rho_0(x) = \frac{1}{Z_0}e^{-u_0(x)}$, whose typical configurations form a contiguous set $C_0$ that encompasses all sets $\{C_i\}_{i=1}^m$ associated to a number $m$ of states of interest. In this case, instead of sampling configurations at these states, we do it at state $0$ and then compute every $f_i$ by employing the perturbation formula
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:umbrella sampling free energy}
f_i = -\ln \langle e^{u_0-u_i} \rangle_0.
\end{equation}

As explained above, the dominant set $D_0$ will coincide with $C_i$, thus being a subset of $C_0$ as desired. Torrie and Valleau\cite{Torrie_1977} pioneered this idea, for which they coined the term \textit{umbrella sampling}. The method is also known as \textit{non-Boltzmann sampling} due to the usually unphysical character of the sampled state. One is also able to compute, directly from the configurations sampled at state $0$, ensemble averages of any property $A$ at the states of interest. This procedure, known as \textit{reweighting}, is based on the identity\cite{Torrie_1977}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:umbrella sampling reweighting}
\langle A \rangle_i = \frac{\langle A e^{u_0 - u_i} \rangle_0}{\langle e^{u_0 - u_i} \rangle_0} = \langle A e^{u_0 - u_i + f_i} \rangle_0.
\end{equation}

The multicanonical approach\cite{Berg_1992, Lee_1993, Abreu_2006} and the enveloping distribution method\cite{Christ_2007, *Christ_2008, *Christ_2009} are examples of successful non-Boltzmann sampling techniques. One of particular importance to the train of thought we intend to develop here is the method of \textit{expanded ensembles}.\cite{Lyubartsev_1992} As described in the subsection that follows, it is a non-Boltzmann sampling scheme closely related to staging.

\subsection{Expanded Ensemble}

The method consists in simulating a combination of several states whose individual distributions overlap, but performing a random walk through such states instead of sampling them independently. The joint probability of configurations and states is given by\cite{Nymeyer_2010}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:expanded ensemble joint}
p_0(x, i) = \frac{1}{Z_0} e^{-u_i(x) + \eta_i},
\end{equation}
where $\eta_i$ is an arbitrary weighting factor. The marginal probability $\pi_i$ of each state $i$ is obtained by integrating $p_0(x,i)$ over the configurational space. One can also obtain the marginal probability density $\rho_0(x)$ by summing $p_0(x,i)$ for all $m$ states. These procedures yield
\begin{align}
\pi_i = \frac{Z_i}{Z_0} e^{\eta_i} = e^{\eta_i - f_i} \quad \text{and} \label{eq:expanded ensemble prior} \\
\rho_0(x) = \frac{1}{Z_0} \sum_{j=1}^m e^{-u_j(x) + \eta_j}. \label{eq:expanded ensemble evidence}
\end{align}

Once the vector $\vt \eta$ of weighting factors is defined, there are several ways of performing importance sampling from the probability in Eq.~\eqref{eq:expanded ensemble joint}. One can use it, for instance, in a MC simulation that involves both configurational and state-changing moves.\cite{Lyubartsev_1992} This will result in a sample $S = \{x_k,i_k\}_{k=1}^n$, with each configuration bearing a state-indicating label. Another way is via MC or MD of a system whose reduced potential is computed by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:expanded ensemble potential}
u_0(x) = - \ln \sum_{j=1}^m e^{-u_j(x) + \eta_j},
\end{equation}
which results in the probability density of Eq.~\eqref{eq:expanded ensemble evidence}. In this case, the sampled configurations will not bear any labels at first. However, if somehow these labels are needed, we can randomly pick a label for each configuration from the conditional distribution $p(i|x)$.\cite{Nymeyer_2010} From Bayes' theorem $p(x,i) = p(x|i) p(i) = p(i|x) p(x)$, we can divide Eq.~\eqref{eq:expanded ensemble joint} by Eq.~\eqref{eq:expanded ensemble evidence} to find out that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:expanded ensemble posterior}
p(i|x) = \frac{e^{-u_i(x) + \eta_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^m e^{-u_j(x) + \eta_j}}.
\end{equation}

In addition, we can also divide Eq.~\eqref{eq:expanded ensemble joint} by Eq.~\eqref{eq:expanded ensemble prior} to see how configurations are distributed within each state. The results is $p(x|i) = Z_0^{-1} e^{u_i(x) + f_i}$, which is identical to Eq.~\eqref{eq:state_prob_density_Z0} and proves that each state of the expanded ensemble is sampled correctly. Together with Bayes' theorem, this can also be used to show that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mixture ensemble}
\rho_0(x) = \sum_{i=1}^m \pi_i \rho_i(x),
\end{equation}
which means that an expanded ensemble distribution is actually a \textit{mixture model}\cite{Lindsay_1995, Marin_2005} composed of the distributions at all states. The method proposed by Nymeyer\cite{Nymeyer_2010} and a special case of the one devised by Christ and van Gunsteren\cite{Christ_2007, *Christ_2008, *Christ_2009} are examples of using Eq.~\eqref{eq:expanded ensemble potential} to perform non-Boltzmann sampling with MD. A third method for sampling from an expanded ensemble is known as \textit{Gibbs sampling}.\cite{Marin_2005, Chodera_2011} While the state $i$ is kept fixed, configurations can be sampled from $p(x|i)$ via MC or MD. Also, while keeping the configuration $x$ fixed, a state can be chosen according to $p(i|x)$. Alternating these procedures will produce the correct expanded ensemble distribution.\cite{Chodera_2011}

Once a sample $S$ has been generated, a simple estimator for the relative free energy of each state stems from Eq.~\eqref{eq:expanded ensemble prior} by making $\hat \pi_i = n_i/n$, where $n_i$ is the number of appearances of state $i$ in $S$. The result is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:expanded ensemble histogram estimator}
\hat f_i = \eta_i - \ln \frac{n_i}{n}.
\end{equation}

However, a better estimator can be obtained by combining Eqs.~\eqref{eq:umbrella sampling free energy} and \eqref{eq:expanded ensemble potential} and then using Eq.~\eqref{eq:average_estimator} to compute the required ensemble average. It is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:expanded ensemble FEP estimator}
\hat f_i = -\ln \left[ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{e^{-u_i(x_k)}}{\sum_{j=1}^m e^{-u_j(x_k) + \eta_j}} \right].
\end{equation}

Both estimators neglect the detailed association of configurations to states. This is due to an essential feature of importance sampling, in that every sampled configuration contributes equally to an ensemble average. During the simulation of a complex system, it is a common practice to store only a small set of collective properties for posterior analysis. In this case, if the second estimator is to be used, one must ensure that such set includes all the potentials present in Eq.~\eqref{eq:expanded ensemble FEP estimator} or other properties from which they can be computed afterwards. Finally, we remark that the set of weighting factors is often chosen so that all states are visited with equal frequency. For this to occur, we must impose that $\eta_i = f_i - \ln m$, which can only be achieved iteratively. Other strategies have also been proposed to select suitable weighting factors or reduced potentials that improve performance and avoid ergodicity issues. Details can be found in Refs.~\onlinecite{Katzgraber_2006, Trebst_2006, Escobedo_2007, *Escobedo_2008, *Martinez_2008}.

\subsection{Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio}

An interesting feature of the method of expanded ensembles is that the walk through the multiple states favors ergodicity in each state, as compared to sampling each one individually. Nevertheless, the process of determining convenient states and weights can be tedious and time-consuming. It is more likely that we face the situation described in Sec.~\ref{sec:definitions}, when samples individually drawn at different states are available. An advantage of this scenario is that inclusion of new states, if necessary, is straightforward. In this case, the pooled sample can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pooled sample}
\mathcal S = \Big\{\{x_{i,k}\}_{k=1}^{n_i}\Big\}_{i=1}^m.
\end{equation}

Shirts and Chodera\cite{Shirts_2008} described a method for computing relative free energies and their uncertainties by using all configurations in $\mathcal S$, provided that each sample is composed of independent and identically distributed (iid) configurations. The authors named the method as Multistate Bennet Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) because it is equivalent to BAR when only two states are involved. Let us derive their estimator from a simple argument before embarking in a detailed analysis. MBAR consists in assigning the same importance to every configuration, regardless of which state it comes from. We can thus overlook the subset structure of Eq.~\eqref{eq:pooled sample} and write $\mathcal S = \{x_k\}_{k=1}^n$. This is equivalent to viewing $\mathcal S$ as the outcome of an expanded ensemble simulation whose weighting factors are unknown and must be estimated as well as the relative free energies. For this reason, we are compelled to use both estimators in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:expanded ensemble histogram estimator} and \eqref{eq:expanded ensemble FEP estimator}, rather than choosing one of them. A combination of these estimators yield
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mbar free energy estimator}
\hat f_i = -\ln \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{e^{-u_i(x_k)}}{\sum_{j=1}^m n_j e^{-u_j(x_k) + \hat f_j}},
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to Eq.~11 of Ref.~\onlinecite{Shirts_2008}. Note that this is not an isolated estimator, but a self-consistent system of equations whose solution provides the whole vector $\hat {\vt f}$. In fact, because the solution can only be determined up to an additive constant, one can fix $\hat f_1$ and solve the remaining equations in order to obtain $\{\hat f_i\}_{i=2}^m$. Once the solution has been found, we can compute the potential $u_0$ that defines the mixture distribution $\rho_0(x)$ via Eq.~\eqref{eq:expanded ensemble potential} with $\eta_j = \hat f_j + \ln \frac{n_j}{n}$. This enables us to employ Eqs.~\eqref{eq:umbrella sampling free energy} and \eqref{eq:umbrella sampling reweighting} in order to perform FEP and/or reweighting calculations from the mixture to individual states (either sampled or unsampled ones).\cite{Geyer_1994, Shirts_2017}

As the $m$ samples in $\mathcal S$ are generated independently, giving all configurations the same importance seems unsuitable if these samples consist of correlated time series with distinct mixing times. This is one reason why MBAR is meant to deal with uncorrelated data and, as such, requires subsampling if the series obtained at any state is originally correlated.\cite{Shirts_2008} For a series $\{x_{i,k}\}_{k=1}^{n_i}$ drawn at state $i$, the subsampling interval should be set as the statistical inefficiency of some configurational property (e.g. the reduced potential $u_i$). The statistical inefficiency of a property $A(x)$ can be computed as\cite{Chodera_2007}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:statistical inefficiency}
g_i = 1 + 2 \sum\limits_{t=1}^{n_i-1} \frac{n_i - t}{n_i} \alpha_i(t),
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_i(t)$ is the normalized autocorrelation function of $A$, calculated by
\begin{equation*}
\alpha_i(t) = \frac{\dfrac{1}{n_i - t} \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n_i-t} [A(x_{i,k}) - \bar A_i][A(x_{i,k+t}) - \bar A_i]}{\dfrac{1}{n_i} \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n_i} [A(x_{i,k}) - \bar A_i]^2}.
\end{equation*}

Ideally, one should compute $g_i$ for a number of relevant properties and take the largest one as the subsampling interval.\cite{Shirts_2008} The autocorrelation function $\alpha_i(t)$ is expected to asymptotically decay to zero for most properties, but in practice its tail fluctuates around zero. Chodera \textit{et al}.\cite{Chodera_2007} proposed that the sum in Eq.~\eqref{eq:statistical inefficiency} should be truncated right before $\alpha_i(t)$ crosses zero for the first time, arguing that the function becomes statistically indistinguishable from zero at this point.

The most important reason why MBAR requires uncorrelated data is concerned with the determination of uncertainties. The estimator has appeared in the literature under other denominations such as Biased Sampling,\cite{Vardi_1985, *Gill_1988} Reverse Logistic Regression,\cite{Geyer_1994} and Extended Bridge Sampling.\cite{Meng_1996, Kong_2003, Tan_2004} It has been derived in several ways from the principle of maximum likelihood, which can lead to standardized proofs of central limit theorems (CLT's), thus providing reliable estimates of asymptotic covariance matrices.\cite{Pawitan_2001, Greene_2012} These proofs, however, often follow from the premise that iid samples are available. Shirts and Chodera\cite{Shirts_2008} established MBAR from a more general version of Eq.~\eqref{eq:mbar free energy estimator}, put forward by Kong \textit{et al}.,\cite{Kong_2003} in which a function $q_i(x)$ and a constant $\hat c_i$ replace the terms $e^{-u_i(x)}$ and $e^{-\hat f_i}$, respectively. That is,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kong et al estimator}
\hat c_i = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{q_i(x_k)}{\sum_{j=1}^m n_j q_j(x_k) \hat c_j^{-1}}.
\end{equation}

This opens up the possibility of releasing some function $q_i(x)$ from being strictly non-negative, provided that $n_i = 0$ because it would not be an actual probability density. Kong \textit{et al}.\cite{Kong_2003} also developed an expression, valid for iid samples, for estimating a matrix whose each element $\hat \Theta_{i,j}$ is the asymptotic covariance between $\ln \hat c_i$ and $\ln \hat c_j$ obtained after solving Eq.~\eqref{eq:kong et al estimator} self-consistently. Such expression is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mbar covariance matrix}
\hat{\mt \Theta} = \tr{\mt W}(\mt I - {\mt W}{\mt N}\tr{\mt W})^+{\mt W},
\end{equation}
where $\mt W$ is an $n \times m$ matrix with $W_{k,i} = \frac{q_i(x_k) \hat c_i^{-1}}{\sum_{j=1}^m n_j q_j(x_k) \hat c_j^{-1}}$, $\mt I$ is the $n \times n$ identity matrix, and $\mt N$ is an $m \times m$ diagonal matrix with $N_{i,i} = n_i$. The superscript $+$ denotes a Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, required because the expression in parentheses results in a singular matrix. We remark that the potential issue of computing the pseudoinverse of a very large matrix can be mitigated in most cases (see Ref.~\onlinecite{Shirts_2008} for details). From the covariance matrix, we can use the delta method\cite{Greene_2012} to estimate the squared error $\delta^2 Y$ of any property $Y$ that depends analytically on the set $\{\ln c_i\}_{i=1}^m$. In the case of a free energy difference $\Delta \hat f_{i,j}$, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mbar free mean-square error}
\delta^2 \Delta {\hat f_{i,j}} = {\hat \Theta}_{i,i} - 2 {\hat \Theta}_{i,j} + {\hat \Theta}_{j,j}.
\end{equation}

In the case of a perturbation calculation to compute the relative free energy of an unsampled state with reduced energy $u(x)$, 

In a comment attached to Ref.~\onlinecite{Kong_2003}, Doss suggested a way of exploring this possibility in order to estimate the uncertainties of not only free-energy differences, but also other ensemble averages given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:umbrella sampling reweighting}. His suggestion requires estimating a matrix $\hat {\mt \Theta}$ whose each element $\hat \Theta_{i,j}$ is the asymptotic covariance between $\ln \hat c_i$ and $\ln \hat c_j$ obtained after solving Eq.~\eqref{eq:kong et al estimator} self-consistently. In MBAR, this is done by using the formula proposed by Kong \textit{et al}.,\cite{Kong_2003} which relies on the assumption of iid samples. It is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\delta^2 \bar A}{\bar A^2} = {\hat \Theta}_{m+1,m+1} - 2 {\hat \Theta}_{m+1,m+2} + {\hat \Theta}_{m+2,m+2}
\end{equation*}

\section{Taking Full Advantage of Correlated Data from Multiple States}

The requirement of subsampling often causes MBAR to waste a considerable amount of data. Although the discarded configurations carry less information than do the ones that remain, they could possibly have a positive impact on the quality of a statistical analysis. Here we propose an unwasteful extension of MBAR, which allows one to employ all available data even if each individual sample has a distinct statistical inefficiency. The starting point for the new method is an exact equation which is also behind MBAR. From Eqs.~\eqref{eq:umbrella sampling free energy}, \eqref{eq:expanded ensemble prior}, and \eqref{eq:expanded ensemble potential}, we find out that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mbar free energy exact}
f_i = -\ln \left\langle \frac{e^{-u_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^m \pi_j e^{-u_j + f_j}} \right\rangle_0.
\end{equation}

In MBAR, the ensemble average above is estimated by applying Eq.~\eqref{eq:average_estimator} to the pooled sample $\mathcal S$ as a whole. This causes all the restraints discussed in the preceding section for implying that $\mathcal S$ must be distributed according to the density $\rho_0(x)$ as given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:mixture ensemble}. In this case, both vectors $\vt \pi$ and $\vt f$ must be estimated from the data. However, from Eqs.~\eqref{eq:ensemble average} and \eqref{eq:mixture ensemble} one can show that, for a mixture model,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mblock average}
\langle A \rangle_0 = \sum_{i=1}^m \pi_i \langle A \rangle_i.
\end{equation}

Therefore, an average at the mixture state can be estimated from averages at the individual ones, which requires no assumption about the distribution of the pooled sample. Note that Eq.~\eqref{eq:ensemble average} is valid regardless of the statistical inefficiency of the sample, which makes the equation above . Moreover, the estimator is valid for any mixture model composed of the same individual states, making us free to choose the vector of marginal probabilities $\vt \pi$ beforehand. Evidently, the choice might affect the asymptotic uncertainty of the estimator. The estimator 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mblock free energy exact}
{\hat f}_i = -\ln \sum_{j=1}^m \frac{\pi_j}{n_j} \sum_{k=1}^{n_i} \frac{e^{-u_i(x_{j,k})}}{\sum_{s=1}^m \pi_s e^{-u_s(x_{j,k}) + {\hat f}_s}}.
\end{equation}




In the subsections that follow, we discuss on the estimation of the relative free energies and on the reweighting procedures to compute free energies and other properties at both sampled and unsampled states.


, but we leave the discussion for the 




Thus, a new exact version of Eq.~\eqref{eq:mbar free energy exact} is

The equation above suggests a new estimator that requires no assumption about 


\begin{equation}
\rho_0(x) = \frac{1}{Z_0} \sum_{i=1}^m \pi_i e^{-u_i(x) + f_i}.
\end{equation}



First, Eqs.~\eqref{eq:expanded ensemble prior} and \eqref{eq:expanded ensemble potential} can be combined to give
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mblock potential}
f_i = -\ln \left\langle \frac{e^{-u_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^m \pi_j e^{-u_j + f_j}} \right\rangle_0.
\end{equation}



As an argument to back up the proposed method, we state that a polled sample as the one in Eq.~\eqref{eq:pooled sample} can be used to estimate 

The proposed method is also a mixture model,  





A set of equations that link the relative free energies to ensemble averages, but are devoid of such weights, can be obtained from Eqs.~\eqref{eq:umbrella sampling free energy}, \eqref{eq:expanded ensemble prior}, and \eqref{eq:expanded ensemble potential}. It is, for all $i$ from $1$ to $m$,


\section{DRAFT}



Following this reasoning, the same importance is assigned \textit{a priori} to every configuration in the pooled sample $\mathcal S$, that is, 


. This makes $\pi_i = n_i/n$, where $n = \sum_{i=1}^m n_i$, since each configuration 



This renders the association of a state to each configuration irrelevant, so that we can overlook the subset structure of Eq.~\eqref{eq:pooled sample} and write $\mathcal S = \{x_k\}_{k=1}^n$. The only information 

The prior probability of each state is proportional to 

makes $\pi_i = n_i/n$, where $n = \sum_{i=1}^m n_i$, and renders the association of configurations to states irrelevant. We can thus overlook the subset structure of Eq.~\eqref{eq:pooled sample} and write $\mathcal S = \{x_k\}_{k=1}^n$. Finally, the estimator that stems from Eq.~\eqref{eq:mbar free energy exact} is

This expression, which is equivalent to Eq.~11 of Ref.~\onlinecite{Shirts_2008}, could have also been obtained directly from the estimators in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:expanded ensemble histogram estimator} and \eqref{eq:expanded ensemble FEP estimator}. Some of its features deserve attention. First, it is not an isolated estimator, but a self-consistent system of equations whose solution estimates the whole set $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^m$. Second, it is 

Log-quasi-likelihood:\cite{Geyer_1994}
\begin{equation*}
\ln \mathcal L = \sum_{k=1}^n \ln p(i_k|x_k) = \sum_{k=1}^n -u_i(x) + \eta_i - \ln \sum_{j=1}^m e^{-u_j(x) + \eta_j}.
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mbar log quasi-likelihood}
\ln \mathcal L = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^m \sum_{l=1}^{n_k} \ln p(k|x_{k,l}),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
\ln p(k|x) = -u_k(x) + f_k + \ln \pi_k - \ln \sum_{s=1}^m \pi_s e^{-u_s(x) + f_s}.
\end{equation*}


\section{A Generalization of MBAR}

Eqs.~\eqref{eq:expanded ensemble prior}, \eqref{eq:expanded ensemble evidence}, and \eqref{eq:state_prob_density_Z0} can be combined to give
\begin{equation*}
\rho_0(x) = \frac{1}{Z_0} \sum_{i=1}^m \pi_i e^{-u_i(x) + f_i} = \sum_{i=1}^m \pi_i \rho_i(x).
\end{equation*}

This shows that $\rho_0(x)$ is a mixture of the probability densities of all states. Therefore, an ensemble average at state $0$ is
\begin{equation*}
\langle A \rangle_0 = \sum_{i=1}^m \pi_i \langle A \rangle_i.
\end{equation*}

Thus, from Eq.~\eqref{eq:mbar free energy exact}:
\begin{equation}
f_i = -\ln \sum_{j=1}^m \pi_j \left\langle \frac{e^{-u_i}}{\sum_{s=1}^m \pi_s e^{-u_s + f_s}} \right\rangle_j.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\hat f_i = -\ln \sum_{j=1}^m \frac{\pi_j}{n_j} \sum_{k=1}^{n_j} \frac{e^{-u_i(x_{j,k})}}{\sum_{s=1}^m \pi_s e^{-u_s(x_{j,k}) + \hat f_s}}.
\end{equation}


Definition 1: $p_i(x)$ is the probability of state $i$ for a given configuration $x$
\begin{equation}
p_i(x) = p(i|x) = \frac{\pi_i e^{-u_i(x) + f_i}}{\sum_{s=1}^m \pi_s e^{-u_s(x) + \hat f_s}}
\end{equation}

Definition 2: $M_{ij}$ is the average probability of state $i$ for all configurations sampled at state $j$:
\begin{equation*}
M_{ij} = \langle p_i \rangle_j \approx \frac{1}{n_j} \sum_{k=1}^{n_j} p_i(x_{jk})
\end{equation*}

Therefore, $\vt M$ is a stochastic matrix and, consequently, the Perron-Frobenius theorem applies. GMBAR in matrix notation:
\begin{equation*}
\mt M \vt \pi = \vt \pi
\end{equation*}

Thus, we have to look for a matrix $\mt M$ whose limiting distribution is $\vt \pi$.

\subsection{Maximum Quasi-Likelihood Derivation}

Log quasi-likelihood function\cite{Geyer_1992, Geyer_1994}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gmbar log quasi-likelihood}
\ln \mathcal L = \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{\pi_k}{n_k} \sum_{l=1}^{n_k} \ln p(k|x_{k,l}),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
\ln p(k|x) = -u_k(x) + f_k + \ln \pi_k - \ln \sum_{s=1}^m \pi_s e^{-u_s(x) + f_s}.
\end{equation*}

By straightforward differentiation, we can obtain the first and second derivatives of $\ln p(k|x)$ with respect to $f_i$ and $f_j$, which are
\begin{gather*}
\frac{\partial \ln p(k|x)}{\partial f_i} = \delta_{i,k} - p(i|x) \quad \text{and} \\
\frac{\partial^2\ln p(k|x)}{\partial f_i \partial f_j} = -p(i|x)[\delta_{i,j} - p(j|x)],
\end{gather*}
where $\delta_{i,j}$ is the Kronecker delta. From these derivatives, we find out that
\begin{equation*}
s_i = \frac{\partial \ln \mathcal L}{\partial f_i} = \pi_i - \sum_{k=1}^m M_{i,k} \pi_k,
\end{equation*}
where $M_{i,k}$ is the mean posterior probability of state $i$ among the configurations sampled at state $k$, that is,
\begin{equation*}
M_{i,k} = \frac{1}{n_k} \sum_{l=1}^{n_k} p(i|x_{k,l}).
\end{equation*}

Note that $\mt M$ is the overlap matrix defined in Ref.~\onlinecite{Klimovich_2015}.

If we define an information matrix $\mt B$ as the reciprocal of the Hessian matrix of $\ln \mathcal L$ with respect to the relative free energies, so that $B_{i,j} = -\frac{\partial^2 \ln \mathcal L}{\partial f_i \partial f_j}$, we have
\begin{equation*}
B_{i,j} = \delta_{i,j} \sum_{k=1}^m M_{i,k} \pi_k - \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{\pi_k}{n_k} \sum_{l=1}^{n_k} p(i|x_{k,l})p(j|x_{k,l}).
\end{equation*}

In matrix notation:
\begin{equation*}
\mt B = \text{diag}(\mt M \vt \pi) - \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{\pi_i}{n_i} \mt P_i \tr{\mt P}_i,
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
\mt \Omega_k = \frac{\mt P_k \tr{\mt P}_k}{n_k}.
\end{equation*}


\begin{equation}
x_{max} + \ln \sum_{i=1}^n a_i e^{x_i -x_{max}}
\end{equation}

Newton-Raphson:
\begin{equation*}
\Delta \vt f
\end{equation*}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Solvation of Propane in Water}

In order to compare the proposed method against MBAR in regard to the calculation of relative free energies of sampled states, we simulated the infinite-dilution solvation of propane in water. Both molecules are modeled as rigid bodies. The intermolecular interactions between water atoms and propane pseudo-atoms are calculated by the softcore potential\cite{Beutler_1994} $\nu(r,\lambda) = 4\lambda\epsilon(s^{-2} - s^{-1})$, where $s = (r/\sigma)^6 + 0.5 (1-\lambda)$.

\section{DRAFT}

visiting other states with faster mixing will help 

Based on the work of Vardi,\cite{Vardi_1985} Geyer,\cite{Geyer_1994} Meng and Wong,\cite{Meng_1996}, Kong \textit{et al}.\cite{Kong_2003}, and Tan\cite{Tan_2004}

Reweighting mixture\cite{Geyer_1994}:
\begin{equation*}
\rho_0(x) = \frac{1}{Z_0} \sum_{i=1}^{n_0} \pi_i e^{-u_i(x) + f_i}
\end{equation*}

Since $\rho_0 = \frac{1}{Z_0} e^{-u_0}$, the equation above results in the following reduced potential
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mbar_reduced_potential}
u_0(x) = -\ln \sum_{i=1}^m \pi_i e^{-u_i(x) + f_i}
\end{equation}





The probability density $\rho_i(x)$ can be interpreted as a conditional probability of configuration $x$ given state $i$, i.e. $\rho_i(x) = p(x|i)$. We can join all configurations sampled in states $1$ to $m$ together as if they were sampled from a single state $0$. In this case, $n_0 = \sum_{k=1}^m n_k$. Let us assume the prior probability that a configuration comes from state $i$ as being $p(i) = n_i/n_0$. In this case, the Bayes theorem yields
\begin{equation*}
p(x|i) p(i) = p(i|x) p(x)
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
p_i \rho_i(x) = p(i|x) \rho_0(x)
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mbar_probability_density}
\rho_0(x) = \sum_{i=1}^m p_i \rho_i(x) = \frac{1}{Z_0} \sum_{i=1}^m p_i e^{-u_i(x) + f_i}
\end{equation}

Since $\rho_0 = \frac{1}{Z_0} e^{-u_0}$, the equation above results in the following reduced potential
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mbar_reduced_potential}
u_0(x) = -\ln \sum_{i=1}^m p_i e^{-u_i(x) + f_i}
\end{equation}

From Eqs.~\eqref{eq:umbrella_sampling_free_energy} and \eqref{eq:average_estimator},
\begin{equation*}
f_i = -\ln \sum_{k=1}^{n_0} \frac{e^{-u_i(x_k)}}{\sum_{j=1}^m n_j e^{-u_j(x_k) + f_j}}
\end{equation*}

An average in the reference state can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:average_reference_state}
\langle A \rangle_0 = \sum_{i=1}^m p_i \langle A \rangle_i
\end{equation}

Therefore,
\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:mbar_free_energy_difference}
\Delta f_{ij} = - \ln \frac{\sum_{k=1}^m p_k \langle e^{-w_j} \rangle_k}{\sum_{k=1}^m p_k \langle e^{-w_i} \rangle_k}.
\end{equation*}

The delta method:
\begin{align*}
\sigma^2_{\Delta \hat f_{ij}} &= \frac{1}{e^{-\Delta f_{ij}}} \sum_{k=1}^m \Bigg[ \left(\frac{p_k}{\sum_{l=1}^m p_l \langle e^{-w_i} \rangle_l } \right)^2 \sigma^2_{\langle e^{-w_j} \rangle_k} \\
&+ \left( \frac{\sum_{l=1}^m p_l \langle e^{-w_j} \rangle_l}{(\sum_{l=1}^m p_l \langle e^{-w_i} \rangle_l)^2}\right)^2 p_k^2 \sigma^2_{\langle e^{-w_i} \rangle_k} \Bigg]
\end{align*}

\section{Conclusion}

Free-energy perturbation is an accurate method when the typical configurations of the target state form a significant subset of the typical configurations of the sampled state.

We tried to interpret different methods simply as distinct choices of a reduced potential $u_0(x)$ for the reference state, expressed as an analytical function $u_0 = u_0(u_1,\dots,u_n)$.
